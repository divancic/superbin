# SuperBin

## Introduction

SuperBin strives to be a generic C++ class for arbitrary large numbers. I started
building it for ADEL (readon) but soon realised it could be much more than
that. Class is kinda half-done: it has all backbone methods but it does not
have (at the time of this writing) any C++ operators and such defined.
